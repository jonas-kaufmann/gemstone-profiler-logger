Three use cases:
  1) measuring total counts for an application. E.g. get counts for running 'basicmath'
       1. start continuous (raw counts only, not rate)
       2. take stamp at beginning
       3. take stamp at end
       4. post process with python
  2) measure counts continuous. E.g. collect data for model building, etc.
  3) measure continuous rate. E.g. run power model, PRIME

Make 2 and 3 the same but with simple on/off
